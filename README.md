# Hi There!

## Who am I?
I'm a full stack developer based in the UK. I work with individual clients and alongside agencies to provide bespoke solutions from wordpress to native app development.

## What am I working on?
Currently I'm developing two services, TinyInvoice and PhramaSea. They are both full stack applications built on unique and lean tech stacks including frameworks like flask and tailwind.
